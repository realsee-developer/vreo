   * 5.3 When the Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and 
   * liabilities that You and Realsee have benefited from, been subject to (or which

   * OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR FROM THE DISTRIBUTION OR USE OF INTEGRATED PRODUCT

   * Party”) from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, expenses, and 
   * costs (including without limitation attorneys’ fees and court costs) incurred by 
   * a Realsee Indemnified Party as a result of: (i) Your non-compliance with any 
   * terms of this Agreement; (ii) Your use of the SDK (or any part thereof); or

   * Product infringes the copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual 
   * property right of a third party.
   * 9. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.
   * Portions of the SDK may utilize or include third party software and other 
   * copyrighted material. Acknowledgments, licensing terms, and disclaimers for such 
   * material are contained in Documentation for the SDK or may otherwise accompany 
   * such material, and Your use of such materials governed by their respective 
   * terms. In the event of conflict between the terms of this Agreement and an 
   * applicable open source or third party agreement, the open source or third party 
   * agreement will control solely with respect to the open source software or third

   * source license.
   * 10. NON-BLOCKING OF REALSEE DEVELOPMENT.

   * the jurisdiction(s) in which the SDK (or any part thereof) was obtained. In 
   * particular, but without limitation, the SDK may not be exported or re-exported 
   * (i) into any U.S. embargoed countries or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury 
   * Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of 
   * Commerce Denied Person's List or Entity List. By using the SDK (or any part 
   * thereof), You represent and warrant that You are not located in any such country 
   * or on any such list.

   * China (for purpose of this Agreement, excluding Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau),

   * or claim arising from or in connection with this Agreement, or the breach, 
   * termination or invalidity thereof, shall be submitted to China International

   * binding upon both parties.
   * 11.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of 
   * competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any reason, the remaining 
   * provisions hereof will be unaffected and remain in full force and effect.

   * without notice to You, to make revisions to this Agreement in our sole and

   * all previous versions and shall be made available on the website where the SDK 
   * is made available, or by such other means as Realsee may determine in its 
   * discretion. Any modified versions of this Agreement hereto shall take effect 
   * from the time that it is made available. You shall be responsible for regularly 
   * checking for notice of any such modifications. You agree that Your continued use 
   * of the SDK constitutes Your agreement to the modified Agreement.
   * 11.5 Relationship of the Parties. This Agreement will not be construed as 
   * creating an agency, partnership, joint venture, fiduciary duty, or any other 
   * form of legal association between You and Realsee, and You will not represent to 
   * the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance, or otherwise.
   * 11.6 Entire Agreement; Governing Language. This Agreement constitutes the entire 
   * agreement between You and Realsee with respect to the use of the SDK licensed 
   * hereunder and supersedes all prior understandings regarding such subject matter. 
   * No amendment to or modification of this Agreement will be binding unless in

   * Agreement and all related documents shall be drafted in English.
